### Breaking

- Updated to `typed-protocols-1.2`, which requires the introduction of a bunch of `NFData` constraints.
- Updated to `cardano-crypto-class-2.3`, which triggered some renamings.
- Remove the implementation of the `GetStakeSnapshots` ledger query, which is now imported from `cardano-ledger`. The result type, `SnapShots`, was moved to Ledger as well.
