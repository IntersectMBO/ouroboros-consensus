### Breaking

- Cleanup Chain selection:
  - Removed `Ouroboros.Consensus.Fragment.Validated` as it was only an
    indirection over `Ouroboros.Consensus.Fragment.ValidatedDiff`.
  - Initial chain selection now also performs the commit on the forker and
    returns only the selected fragment of headers.
  - Deleted `ChainAndLedger` as it was an unnecessary indirection.
  - Deleted `validateCandidate` as it was an unnecessary indirection to
    `ledgerValidateCandidate` which was now renamed to `validatedCandidate`.
- Cleanup LedgerDB:
  - `validateFork` allows for `l` other than `ExtLedgerState`.
  - `validateFork` expects a non-empty list of headers.
  - `ValidateArgs` now expects an `l` that can be different to `ExtLedgerState`.
  - `Ap` has been simplified to monomorphize the constraints. `applyBlock` and
    related functions now run on an appropriate monad.
  - Classes `ThrowsLedgerErrors` and `ResolvesBlocks` have been deletes as
    unnecessary.
  - `MonadBase` scattered constraints have been removed as unnecessary.
  - `AnnLedgerError` carries a point to the latest valid block instead of a
    forker.
