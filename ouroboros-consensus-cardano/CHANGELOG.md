## 0.6.0.0 — 2023-05-19

### Patch

- Optimise `GetStakeSnapshots` query to not traverse all delegations
  per stake pool, but instead compute the total stake per pool in a
  map and do a lookup
- Update CHaPs dependencies
- Fix performance regression of `GetFilteredDelegationsAndRewardAccounts` query
- Remove deprecated pattern synonyms from `Ouroboros.Consensus.Shelley.Ledger`:
  `GetUTxO` and `GetFilteredUTxO`.

### Breaking

- Bumped latest released node versions to `NodeToNodeV_11` and `NodeToClientV_15`.
- `NodeToClientV_15` enables the deposits query.
- The `GetCurrentPParams` query now uses the legacy en-/decoding for its result again when the `NodeToClientVersion` is `<15`, restoring compatibility with older clients.

### Non-Breaking

- Bump `cardano-ledger-{alonzo,babbage}` to 1.2.1.0, which changes the corresponding `PParams` serialisation. This affects the ledger snapshots, and the `GetCurrentPParams` query for `NodeToClientVersion >= 15`.

## 0.5.0.1 — 2023-04-28

### Patch

- Update `ouroboros-network` dependency.

<a id='changelog-0.5.0.0'></a>
## 0.5.0.0 - 2023-04-24

### Breaking

- Apply new organization of Consensus packages. Absorb `byron`, `shelley`,
  `cardano-tools` and all the testing packages for those.

- Add the new `ShelleyNodeToClientVersion7` to the `ShelleyNodeToClientVersion`

### Non-Breaking

- Add a new ledger query: `GetStakeDelegDeposits`

<a id='changelog-0.4.0.1'></a>
## 0.4.0.1 — 2023-04-10

### Patch

- `ouroboros-consensus-cardano`: Since the filesystem API that lives in
  `ouroboros-consensus` will live in the `fs-api` package for now on, start
  depending on `fs-api`, and change imports accordingly.

- Collapse all imports into one group in every file.
- Adapt to relocation of SOP-related `Util` modules.

<a id='changelog-0.4.0.0'></a>
## 0.4.0.0 — 2023-03-07

### Non-Breaking

- Fix the version bounds for the bundle and version sets the bounds for the
  `ouroboros-consensus` bundle to `^>=0.3`.

### Breaking

- Return stake snapshots for stake pools that have the `Set` or `Go` ledger
  snapshots. When querying `GetStakeSnapshots Nothing`, which means to query for
  all stake pools, previously only stake snapshots for stake pools that have the
  `Mark` ledger snapshot were returned.

<a id='changelog-0.3.0.0'></a>
## 0.3.0.0 — 2023-02-09

### Patch

- Remove redundant proxy argument for `ledgerDbTip`.

### Non-Breaking

- Adapted to the new reorganization of Mempool modules in `ouroboros-consensus`.

### Breaking

####  Added:
- `Conway` to `CardanoEras`
- `NodeToNodeV_11` and `NodeToClientV_15`, both of which enable Conway.
- Conway-related type and pattern synonyms. Eg `StandardConway`, `HeaderConway`,
  `GentTxConway`, etc.

#### Changed

- The `protocolInfoTPraosShelleyBased` and `protocolInfoPraosShelleyBased`
  functions now expect a tuple of the `AdditionalGenesisConfig` and the
  `TranslationContext` instead of just the `TranslationContext`. For all
  Shelley-based eras before Conway, those had been equal types.

### Archaeological remark

Before following a more structured release process, we tracked most significant
changes affecting downstream users in the
[interface-CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/input-output-hk/ouroboros-consensus/blob/8d8329e4dd41404439b7cd30629fcce427679212/docs/website/docs/interface-CHANGELOG.md).
