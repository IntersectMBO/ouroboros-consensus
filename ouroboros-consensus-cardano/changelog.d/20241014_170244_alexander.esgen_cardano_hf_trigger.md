### Breaking

- Changed `CardanoHardTriggers` to contain `CardanoHardForkTrigger`s which are a
  simpler version of the previous `TriggerHardForkAt`. In particular, this will
  affect call sites of `protocolInfoCardano`.

  Migration notes:

    - Change `TriggerHardForkAtEpoch` to `CardanoTriggerHardForkAtEpoch`.
    - Change `TriggerHardForkAtVersion` to `CardanoTriggerHardForkAtDefaultVersion`.

      This constructor does not take a version argument, but rather defaults to
      the corresponding first ledger protocol version. We are not aware of any
      use case that requires a different value, but if there is, it is still
      possible to manually modify the returned `LedgerConfig`s of
      `protocolInfoCardano` directly.
