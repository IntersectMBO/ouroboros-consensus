### Breaking

- Adapt to the fact that block decoders may fail, i.e. change the block annotated decoder types from `Lazy.ByteString -> ShelleyBlock proto era` to `Lazy.ByteString -> Either Plain.DecoderError (ShelleyBlock proto era)`. Very importantly, while `Header` decoding still cannot fail, it has to use the same low-level decoding functions from the Ledger and Networking layers; hence, we have to introduce an `error` call into the `decodeShelleyHeader` to account for an impossible case of `Header` decoding failing and make types match. We aim to remove this error call as soon as possible.
- Introduce transaction levels, adapting to the nested transactions feature in Ledger. Every occurrence of Ledger's `SL.Tx` becomes `SL.Tx SL.TopTx`.
- The serialisation of `ApplyTxError` changes in `CardanoNodeToClient` version from 12 to 19 for all eras except Conway (the current era at the moment). This is due to changes in the `ApplyTxError` type in Ledger.
