### Breaking

- Flip serialization of `TxIx` in Mempack, to ensure lexicographic order on the
  serialized form matches the Haskell Ord, allowing for incremental streaming of
  values among backends. Note this happens at the same time as the versioning of
  the LedgerTables codec which will induce a replay of the chain.
