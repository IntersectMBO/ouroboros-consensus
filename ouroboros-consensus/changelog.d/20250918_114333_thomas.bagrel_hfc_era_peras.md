### Breaking

- Changes in the HFC types:
  - `EraParams` now keeps track of an optional Peras round length.
  - `Bound` now keeps track of an optional Peras round number.
  - In the `Serialise` instances for `EraParams` and `Bound`, the encoders generate different CBOR depending on whether of not the Peras-relate components are present. The decoders act differently depending on the length of the CBOR list.
- Changes in the HFC time translation queries:
  - Two new top-level queries are exposed from `Ouroboros.Consensus.HardFork.History.Qry`:

    ```haskell
    perasRoundNoToSlot :: PerasRoundNo -> Qry SlotNo
    slotToPerasRoundNo :: SlotNo -> Qry PerasRoundNo
    ```

- Add a roundtrip test that ensures that converting Peras round number to a slot and then back is an identity is added into the `Test.Consensus.HardFork.Summary` module.
- Add a Peras-specific test into `Test.Consensus.HardFork.History` module.
