### Patch

- The backing store of the V1 LedgerDB was only tracked in the
  resource registry if we were starting from Genesis. Now the backing
  store will be properly tracked in the resource registry even when we
  start from a snapshot.

- Closing the LedgerDB will no longer release all the open forkers,
  but instead invalidate them by emptying the ldbForkers map, so that
  the only possible operation that could be performed is closing them
  in the LedgerDB clients, such as ChainSel or the forging loop.

- Closing the forker is idempotent, and it was performed both when
  calling `forkerClose` as well as when the resource registry of the
  LedgerDB client was going out of scope. Now, `forkerClose` will
  release the resource from the registry so this won't run twice.
