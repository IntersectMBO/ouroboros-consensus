### Breaking

- Changed pruning of immutable ledger states to happen on LedgerDB garbage
  collection instead of directly on every block adoption. This is purely an
  internal refactoring (with breaking API changes) supporting predictable ledger
  snapshotting.

- Avoid maintaining volatile ledger states during ledger replay, making it
  slightly more efficient.
