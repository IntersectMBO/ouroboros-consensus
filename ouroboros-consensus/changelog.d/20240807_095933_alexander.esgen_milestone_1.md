### Breaking

- Integrated new bulk sync BlockFetch logic.

- CSJ: implemented rotation of dynamos.

- ChainDB: let the BlockFetch client add blocks asynchronously

- GDD: added rate limit

- Tweaked certain edge cases in the GDD and ChainSync client ([#1179](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus/pull/1179))
