### Breaking

- Define new Forker API. Forkers are open as `SimpleForker`s which have no
  tables and can later be promoted to open tables (`TablesReadForker`). In V1
  this will hold the lock until the value handle is created on promotion. In V2
  this change is transaparent.

  Chain selection will use the `FullForker`, block forging will use
  `TablesReadForker`, and queries will use `SimpleForker`s possibly promoting
  them to `TablesReadForker` on the first UTxO-related query.
