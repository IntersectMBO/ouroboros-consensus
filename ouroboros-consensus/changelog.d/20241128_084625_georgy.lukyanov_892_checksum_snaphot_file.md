### Breaking

- When writing a ledger state snapshot to disk, calculate the state's CRC32 checksum and write it to a separate file, which is named the same as the snapshot file, plus the `.checksum` extension.
- When reading a snapshot file in `readSnapshot`, calculate its checksum and compare it to the value in the corresponding `.checksum` file. Return an error if the checksum is different or invalid. Issue a warning if the checksum file does not exist, but still initialise the ledger DB.
- To support the previous item, change the error type of the `readSnapshot` from `ReadIncrementalErr` to the extended `ReadSnaphotErr`.
- Checksumming the snapshots is controlled via the `doChecksum :: Flag "DoDiskSnapshotChecksum"` parameter of `initFromSnapshot`. It is enabled by default in `initLedgerDB` by setting it to `DoDiskSnapshotChecksum` (i.e. `True`).

### Non-breaking

- Make `Ouroboros.Consensus.Util.CBOR.readIncremental` optionally compute the checksum of the data as it is read.
- Introduce an explicit `Ord` instance for `DiskSnapshot` that compares the values on `dsNumber`.
- Introduce a new utility newtype `Flag` to represent type-safe boolean flags. See ouroboros-consensus/src/ouroboros-consensus/Ouroboros/Consensus/Util.hs.
- Use `Flag "DoDiskSnapshotChecksum"` to control the check of the snapshot checksum file in `readSnapshot`
