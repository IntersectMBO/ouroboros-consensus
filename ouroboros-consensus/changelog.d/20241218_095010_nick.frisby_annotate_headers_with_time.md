### Patch

- A bullet item for the Patch category.

### Non-Breaking

- Maintain a parallel selection with time annotations since the
  `ConsensusBlockFetchInterface` uses the same type argument for ChainSync
  candidates and the current selection.

### Breaking

- Define `HeaderWithTime`.

- Use `HeaderWithTime` for the ChainSync candidates.

- Remove `SlotForgeTimeOracle` and its use in the BlockFetch client interface,
  as we no longer translate time in the BlockFetch client.
