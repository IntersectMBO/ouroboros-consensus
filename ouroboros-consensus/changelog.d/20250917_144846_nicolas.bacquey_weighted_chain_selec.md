### Breaking

- Make the `ChainDB` aware of the `PerasCertDB`, and modify the chain selection function accordingly. In practice, it means that the candidate fragment is now selected based on its Peras weight, instead of its length.

  Note that if Peras is disabled (which is the default), there is no observable difference.

- Add module `Ouroboros.Consensus.Peras.SelectView`, which introduces a `WeightedSelectView` to correctly measure the length of a chain fragment.
