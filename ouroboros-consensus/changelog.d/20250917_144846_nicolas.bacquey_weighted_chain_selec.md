### Breaking

- Make the `ChainDB` aware of `CertDB`, and modify the chain selection function accordingly. In practice, it means that the candidate fragment is now selected based on its Peras weight, instead of its length.
- Add module `Ouroboros.Consensus.Peras.SelectView`, which introduces views to correctly measure the length of a chain fragment when accounting for EBBs.
