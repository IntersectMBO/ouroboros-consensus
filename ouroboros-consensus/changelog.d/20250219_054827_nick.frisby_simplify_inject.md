### Breaking

- Make the type of `Nary.inject` more precise.
  The old type involves oracular data, so any required changes downstream are almost certainly limited to testing code.
  (I'm therefore tempted to list this as Patch instead --- violating the [PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org/) --- but the risk-reward seems prohibitive.)
