### Breaking

- Changed `SelectView` to be a data type instead of an associated type of
  `ConsensusProtocol`, which is the combination of a `BlockNo` and a
  `TiebreakerView`, which is a new associated type of `ConsensusProtocol`. This
  makes it explicit that `ouroboros-consensus` is targeting longest chain
  protocols.

  - Removed `PBftSelectView`, use `SelectView PBft` instead.

  - Removed `HardForkSelectView`, use `SelectView (HardForkProtocol xs)` instead.
