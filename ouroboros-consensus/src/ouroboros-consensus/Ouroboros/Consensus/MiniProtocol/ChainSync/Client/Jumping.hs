-- | ChainSync jumping (CSJ) is an optimization for the ChainSync protocol that
-- allows nodes to sync without downloading headers from all of the honest
-- peers. This load is undesirable as it slows down all the peers involved.
--
-- The idea is to download the headers of a chain from a single peer (the
-- dynamo) and then ask periodically to the other peers (the jumpers) whether
-- they agree with the dynamo's chain.
--
-- When the jumpers disagree with the dynamo, the jumper with the oldest
-- intersection is asked to compete with the dynamo in the GDD logic. If the
-- dynamo is disconnected, a new dynamo is elected and the objector is demoted
-- to a jumper.
--
-- If the objector is disconnected, the syncing process continues with the
-- dynamo and the remaining jumpers.
--
-- The main property of the algorithm is that it never
-- downloads headers from more than two plausibly honest peers at a time (a
-- dynamo and an objector). All other peers are either waiting their turn to
-- compete with the dynamo, or are in agreement with it, or are disengaged
-- (see next section).
--
-- The algorithm might still download headers redundantly from peers that do
-- historical rollbacks. These rollbacks, however, constitute dishonest
-- behavior, and CSJ does not concern itself with avoiding load to dishonest
-- peers. Avoiding the load induced by dishonest peers on the syncing node would
-- require additionally to disconnect peers that do historical rollbacks. This
-- is not done by CSJ.
--
-- Interactions with the Genesis Density Disconnection logic
-- ---------------------------------------------------------
--
-- It is possible that neither the dynamo nor the objector are disconnected.
-- This could happen if:
-- 1. They both serve the same chain, or
-- 2. They both claim to have no more headers.
--
-- To avoid (1) CSJ checks that the objector disagrees with the dynamo at the
-- point it claimed to disagree as a jumper. If the objector agrees with the
-- dynamo, it is disengaged. A disengaged peer is not asked to jump or act as
-- dynamo or objector. Instead, it continues to offer headers for the rest of
-- the syncing. When the objector is disengaged, a new objector is elected
-- among the dissenting jumpers. If there are no dissenting jumpers left, the
-- syncing continues with the dynamo and the remaining jumpers.
--
-- To prevent the dynamo from agreeing with the objector instead, the dynamo is
-- not allowed to rollback before the last jump it requested. If the dynamo
-- tries to rollback before the last jump, it is disengaged and a new dynamo is
-- elected.
--
-- To avoid (2) CSJ disengages a peer as soon as it claims to have no more
-- headers. Syncing continues with a new elected dynamo or objector depending on
-- the disengaged peer's role.
--
-- CSJ finishes and is turned off when all peers have been disengaged.
--
-- Interactions with the ChainSync client
-- --------------------------------------
--
-- The ChainSync client interacts with CSJ through some callbacks that determine
-- when the client should pause, download headers, or ask about agreement with
-- a given point (jumping). See the 'Jumping' type for more details.
--
-- Interactions with the Limit on Patience
-- ---------------------------------------
--
-- Jumpers don't leak the Limit on Patience (LoP) bucket until they are promoted
-- to dynamos or objectors. And the leaking is stopped as soon as they are
-- demoted.
--
-- If a jumper refrains from answering to jumps, they will be disconnected with
-- the 'intersectTimeout' (in 'ChainSyncTimeout').
--
-- A jumper answering just before the timeout will not delay the syncing
-- process by a large amount. If they agree with the dynamo, the dynamo will be
-- busy downloading headers and validating blocks while the jumper answers. If
-- the jumper disagrees with the dynamo, CSJ will look for the precise
-- intersection with the dynamo's chain. This could take a few minutes, but it
-- is a path that will end up in one of the dynamo and the jumper being
-- disconnected or disengaged.
--
--
-- Overview of the state transitions
-- ---------------------------------
--
-- See 'ChainSyncJumpingState' for the implementation of the states.

-- *: LookingForIntersection and FoundIntersection, abbreviated for this
--    drawing only; this abbreviation will not be used elsewhere.
--
-- A new peer starts as the dynamo if there is no other peer or as a Happy
-- jumper otherwise. The dynamo periodically requests jumps from happy
-- jumpers who, in the ideal case, accept them.
--
-- In the event that a jumper rejects a jump, it goes from Happy to LFI* (a).
-- From there starts a back-and-forth of intersection search messages until
-- the exact point of disagreement with the dynamo is found.
--
-- Once the exact point of disagreement is found, and if there is no objector
-- yet, the jumper becomes the objector (b). If there is an objector, then we
-- compare the intersections of the objector and the jumper. If the jumper's
-- intersection is strictly older, then the jumper replaces the objector (b+c).
-- Otherwise, the jumper is marked as FI* (d).
--
-- If the dynamo disconnects or is disengaged, one peer is elected as the new
-- dynamo (e|f) and all other peers revert to being happy jumpers (g+h).
--
-- If the objector disconnects or is disengaged, and there are FI* jumpers, then
-- the one with the oldest intersection with the dynamo gets elected (i).
--
-- If the dynamo rolls back to a point older than the last jump it requested, it
-- is disengaged (j) and a new dynamo is elected (e|f).
--
-- If the objector agrees with the dynamo, it is disengaged (k). If there are
-- FI* jumpers, then one of them gets elected as the new objector (i).
--
-- If dynamo or objector claim to have no more headers, they are disengaged
-- (j|k).
