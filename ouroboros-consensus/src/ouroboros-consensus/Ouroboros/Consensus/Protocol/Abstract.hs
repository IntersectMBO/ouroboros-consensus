-- configuration as a parameter, so having this as a data family rather than a
-- type family resolves most ambiguity.

-- having to define the entire protocol at the same time (or indeed in the same

  -- | View on a header required for chain selection
  --
  -- Chain selection is implemented by the chain database, which takes care of
  -- two things independent of a choice of consensus protocol: we never switch
  -- to chains that fork off more than @k@ blocks ago, and we never adopt an
  -- invalid chain. The actual comparison of chains however depends on the chain
  -- selection protocol. We define chain selection in terms of a /select view/
  -- on the headers at the tips of those chains: chain A is strictly preferred
  -- over chain B whenever A's select view is preferred over B's select view
  -- according to the 'ChainOrder' instance.
  type family SelectView p :: Type
  type SelectView p = BlockNo

  -- | Projection of the ledger state the Ouroboros protocol needs access to
  --
  -- The 'LedgerView' is a summary of the state of the ledger that the consensus
  -- algorithm requires to do its job. Under certain circumstances the consensus
  -- algorithm may require the 'LedgerView' for slots in the past (before the
  -- current tip of the chain) or in the (near) future (beyond the tip of the
  -- current chain, without having seen those future blocks yet).
  --
  -- This puts limitations on what the 'LedgerView' can be. For example, it
  -- cannot be the "current stake distribution", since it is of course
  -- impossible to compute the current stake distibution for a slot in the
  -- future. This means that for a consensus algorithm that requires the
  -- stake distribution such as Praos, the 'LedgerView' for a particular slot
  -- must be the "stake distribution for the purpose of leader selection".
  -- This "relevant" stake distribution /can/ be computed for slots in the
  -- (near) future because it is based on historical stake, not current.
  --
  -- A somewhat unfortunate consequence of this is that some decisions that
  -- ought to live in the consensus layer (such as the decision precisely which
  -- historical stake to sample to determine the relevant stake distribution)
  -- instead live in the ledger layer. It is difficult to disentangle this,
  -- because the ledger may indeed /depend/ on those sampling decisions (for
  -- example, reward calculations /must/ be based on that same stake
  -- distribution).
  --
  -- There are also some /advantages/ to moving these sorts of decisions to the
  -- ledger layer. It means that the consensus algorithm can continue to
  -- function without modifications if we decide that the stake distribution for
  -- leader selection should be based on something else instead (for example,
  -- for some bespoke version of the blockchain we may wish to use a committee
  -- instead of a decentralized blockchain). Having sampling decisions in the
  -- ledger layer rather than the consensus layer means that these decisions can
  -- be made without modifying the consensus algorithm.
  --
  -- Note that for the specific case of Praos, whilst the ledger layer provides
  -- the relevant stake distribution, the precise leader election must still live
  -- in the consensus layer since that depends on the computation (and sampling)
  -- of entropy, which is done consensus side, not ledger side (the reward
  -- calculation does not depend on this).

  -- | Compare a candidate chain to our own.
  --
  -- This method defines when a candidate chain is /strictly/ preferable to our
  -- current chain. If both chains are equally preferable, the Ouroboros class
  -- of consensus protocols /always/ sticks with the current chain.
  --
  -- === Requirements
  --
  -- Write @ours ⊏ cand@ for @'preferCandidate' cfg ours cand@ for brevity.
  --
  --  [__Consistency with 'Ord'__]: When @ours ⊏ cand@, then @ours < cand@.
  --
  --      This means that @cand@ can only be preferred over @ours@ when @cand@
  --      is greater than @ours@ according to the 'Ord' instance.
  --
  --      However, this is not necessarily a sufficient condition; a concrete
  --      implementation may decide to not have @ours ⊏ cand@ despite @ours <
  --      cand@ for some pairs @ours, can@. However, it is recommended to think
  --      about this carefully and rather use 'SimpleChainOrder' if possible,
  --      which defines @ours ⊏ cand@ as @ours < cand@, as it simplifies
  --      reasoning about the chain ordering.
  --
  --      However, forgoing 'SimpleChainOrder' can enable more sophisticated
  --      tiebreaking rules that eg exhibit desirable incentive behavior.
  --
  --  [__Chain extension precedence__]: @a@ must contain the underlying block
  --      number, and use this as the primary way of comparing chains.
  --
  --      Suppose that we have a function @blockNo :: sv -> Natural@. Then for
  --      all @a, b@ with @blockNo a < blockNo b@ we must have @a ⊏ b@.
  --
  --      Intuitively, this means that only the logic for breaking ties between
  --      chains with equal block number is customizable via this class.
