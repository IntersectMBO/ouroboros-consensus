type ApplyTxErr :: Type -> Type
type family ApplyTxErr blk

-- | A flag indicating whether the mempool should reject a valid-but-problematic
-- transaction, in order to to protect its author from penalties etc
--
-- The primary example is that, as of the Alonzo ledger, a valid transaction can
-- carry an invalid script. If a remote peer sends us such a transaction (over a
-- Node-to-Node protocol), we include it in a block so that the ledger will
-- penalize them them for the invalid script: they wasted our resources by
-- forcing us to run the script to determine it's invalid. But if our local
-- wallet -- which we trust by assumption -- sends us such a transaction (over a
-- Node-to-Client protocol), we would be a good neighbor by rejecting that
-- transaction: they must have made some sort of mistake, and we don't want the
-- ledger to penalize them.

    -- them for it.

--
-- This optimization is worthwile as snapshotting is in the critical
-- path of block minting, and we don't make use of the resulting
-- state, only of the transactions that remain valid.
--
-- Eventually, the Ledger rules will construct the differences for us,
-- so this optimization will no longer be needed. That's why we chose
-- to go with a boolean isomorph instead of something fancier.

-- generations of Shelley based eras) this measure was simply a byte size

  -- This size is used to compute how many transaction we can put in a block
  -- when forging one.
  --
  -- The byte size component in particular might differ from the size of the
  -- serialisation used to send and receive the transaction across the network.
  -- For example, CBOR-in-CBOR could be used when sending the transaction
  -- across the network, requiring a few extra bytes compared to the actual
  -- in-block serialisation. Another example is the transaction of the
  -- hard-fork combinator which will include an envelope indicating its era
  -- when sent across the network. However, when embedded in the respective
  -- era's block, there is no need for such envelope. An example from upstream
