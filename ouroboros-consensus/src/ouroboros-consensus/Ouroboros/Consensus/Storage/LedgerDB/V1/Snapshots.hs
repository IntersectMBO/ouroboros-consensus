{- | snapshots

  Snapshotting a ledger state means saving a copy of the in-memory part of the
  ledger state serialized as a file on disk, as well as flushing differences on
  the ledger tables between the last snapshotted ledger state and the one that
  we are snapshotting now and making a copy of that resulting on-disk state.

  == Startup

  During initialisation, the goal is to construct an initial 'LedgerDB' where
  the sequence of in-memory states is empty except for the ledger state at the
  anchor or the 'DbChangelog', which has to correspond to the immutable tip,
  i.e., the block at the tip of the Immutable DB.

  Ideally, we can construct the initial 'LedgerDB' from a snapshot of the ledger
  state that we wrote to disk. Remember that updating a ledger state with a
  block is not invertible: we can apply a block to a ledger state, but we cannot
  /unapply/ a block to a ledger state. This means the snapshot has to be at
  least as old as the anchor. A snapshot matching the anchor can be used as is.
  A snapshot older than the anchor can be used after reapplying the necessary
  blocks. A snapshot newer than the anchor can /not/ be used, as we cannot
  unapply blocks to get the ledger state corresponding to the anchor. This is
  the reason why we only take snapshots of an immutable ledger state, i.e., of
  the anchor of the 'DbChangelog' (or older).

  On startup, the node will:

  1. Find the latest snapshot which will be a directory inside @\<cardano-node
       data dir\>\/\<ledger\>@ named as the slot number of the ledger state that
       was snapshotted:

       > <cardano-node data dir>
       > ├── volatile
       > ├── immutable
       > └── ledger
       >     ├── <snap_0>
       >     │   ├── tables
       >     │   └── state
       >     ├── ...
       >     └── <snap_n>
       >         ├── tables
       >         └── state

       The @tables@ file is a serialization of the in-memory part of the ledger
       state with empty tables (i.e. a @ExtLedgerState blk EmptyMK@), and
       @tables@ will store a persistent copy of the 'LedgerTable's. Depending on
       the 'BackingStore' implementation in use, this might be a file or a
       directory.

  2. Depending on the snapshots found, there are two possibilities:

       - If there is no snapshot to load, create a new @'BackingStore'@ with the
         contents of the Genesis ledger tables and finish.

       - If there is a snapshot found, then deserialize (with @DecodeDisk@) the
         @state@ file. If deserialization fails, delete this snapshot and start
         again. If the snapshot is newer than the immutable tip, delete this
         snapshot and start again.

       In case we found an snapshot, we will overwrite (either literally
       overwriting it or using some feature from the specific backend used) the
       @BackingStore@ tables with the contents from @tables@ from said snapshot
       as it was left in whatever state it was when the node shut down.

  3. The deserialized ledger state and tables will be then used as the initial
       ledger state for the ledger database.

  4. Reapply the immutable blocks after the snapshot to obtain the ledger state
       at the immutable tip. The blocks to reapply are streamed from the Immutable
       DB, using an iterator.

       Note that we can /reapply/ these blocks, which is quicker than applying
       them, as the existence of a snapshot newer than these blocks proves (unless
       the on-disk database has been tampered with, but this is not an attack we
       intend to protect against, as this would mean the machine has already been
       compromised) that they have been successfully applied in the past.

  Reading and applying blocks is costly. Typically, very few blocks need to be
  reapplied in practice. However, there is one exception: when the serialisation
  format of the ledger state changes, all snapshots (written using the old
  serialisation format) will fail to deserialise, and all blocks starting from
  genesis will have to be reapplied.

  At this point, the node carries a @DbChangelog@ that is initialized and ready
  to be applied blocks on the volatile database.

  == Taking snapshots during normal operation

  Snapshots are taken by the @'copyAndSnapshotRunner'@ when the disk policy
  dictates to do so. Whenever the chain grows past @k@ blocks, said runner will
  copy the blocks which are more than @k@ blocks from the tip (i.e. the ones
  that must be considered immutable) to the immutable database and then:

  1. Every time we have processed a specific amount of blocks since the last
       flush (set by default to 100), perform a flush of differences in the
       'DbChangelog' up to the immutable db tip.

  2. If dictated by the disk policy, flush immediately all the differences up to
       the immutable db tip and serialize (using 'EncodeDisk') the DbChangelog
       in-memory ledger states anchor (@ExtLedgerState blk EmptyMK@).

       A directory is created named after the slot number of the ledger state
       being snapshotted, and the serialization from above is written into the
       @\<slotNumber\>/state@ file and the @BackingStore@ tables are copied into
       the @\<slotNumber\>/tables@ file.

  3. There is a maximum number of snapshots that should exist in the disk at any
     time, dictated by the @DiskPolicy@, so if needed, we will trim out old
     snapshots.

  == Flush during startup and snapshot at the end of startup

  Due to the nature of the database having to carry around all the differences
  between the last snapshotted state and the current tip, there is a need to
  flush when replaying the chain as otherwise, for example on a replay from
  genesis to the tip, we would carry millions of differences in memory.

  Because of this, when we are replaying blocks we will flush regularly. As the
  last snapshot that was taken lives in a @\<slotNumber\>/tables@ file, there is
  no risk of destroying it (overwriting tables at another earlier snapshot) by
  flushing. Only when we finish replaying blocks and start the background
  threads (and specifically the @copyAndSnapshotRunner@), we will take a
  snapshot of the current immutable database anchor as described above.
