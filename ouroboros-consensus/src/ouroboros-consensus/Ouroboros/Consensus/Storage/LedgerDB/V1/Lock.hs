  LedgerDB lock
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------}

-- | A lock to prevent the LedgerDB (i.e. a 'DbChangelog') from getting out of
-- sync with the 'BackingStore'.
--
-- We rely on the capability of the @BackingStore@s of providing
-- 'BackingStoreValueHandles' that can be used to hold a persistent view of the
-- database as long as the handle is open. Assuming this functionality, the lock
-- is used in three ways:
--
-- - Read lock to acquire a value handle: we do this when acquiring a view of the
--   'LedgerDB' (which lives in a 'StrictTVar' at the 'ChainDB' level) and of
--   the 'BackingStore'. We momentarily acquire a read lock, consult the
--   transactional variable and also open a 'BackingStoreValueHandle'. This is
--   the case for ledger state queries and for the forging loop.
--
-- - Read lock to ensure two operations are in sync: in the above situation, we
--   relied on the 'BackingStoreValueHandle' functionality, but sometimes we
--   won't access the values through a value handle, and instead we might use
--   the LMDB environment (as it is the case for 'lmdbCopy'). In these cases, we
--   acquire a read lock until we ended the copy, so that writers are blocked
--   until this process is completed. This is the case when taking a snapshot.
--
-- - Write lock when flushing differences.
