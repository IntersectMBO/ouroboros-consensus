-- | This module implements a “leaky bucket”. One defines a bucket with a
-- capacity and a leaking rate; a race (in the sense of Async) starts against
-- the bucket which leaks at the given rate. The user is provided with a
-- function to refill the bucket by a certain amount. If the bucket ever goes
-- empty, both threads are cancelled.
--
-- This can be used for instance to enforce a minimal rate of a peer: they race
-- against the bucket and refill the bucket by a certain amount whenever they do
-- a “good” action.
--
-- NOTE: Even though the imagery is the same, this is different from what is
-- usually called a \“token bucket\” or \“leaky bucket\” in the litterature
-- where it is mostly used for rate limiting.
--
-- REVIEW: Could be used as leaky bucket used for rate limiting algorithms. All
-- the infrastructure is here (put 'onEmpty' to @pure ()@ and you're good to go)
-- but it has not been tested with that purpose in mind.

-- $leakyBucketDesign
--
-- Note [Leaky bucket design]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- The leaky bucket works by running the given action against a thread that
-- makes the bucket leak. Since it would be inefficient to actually
-- remove tokens one by one from the bucket, the 'leak' thread instead looks at
-- the current state of the bucket, computes how much time it would take for the
-- bucket to empty, and then wait that amount of time. Once the wait is over, it
-- recurses, looks at the new state of the bucket, etc. If tokens were given to
-- the bucket via the action, the bucket is not empty and the loop continues.
--
-- This description assumes that two things hold:
--
--  - the bucket must be leaking (ie. rate is strictly positive),
--  - the action can only increase the waiting time (eg. by giving tokens).
--
-- Neither of those properties hold in the general case. Indeed, it is possible
-- for the bucket to have a zero rate or even a negative one (for a more
-- traditional rate limiting bucket, for instance). Conversely, it is possible
-- for the action to lower the waiting time by changing the bucket configuration
-- to one where the rate is higher.
--
-- We fix both those issues with one mechanism, the @leakingPeriodVersionSTM@.
-- It is a computation returning an integer that identifies a version of the
-- configuration that controls the leaking period. If the computation blocks,
-- it means that no configuration has been determined yet.
-- The leak thread first waits until @leakingPeriodVersionSTM@ yields a
-- value, and only then proceeds as described above.
-- Additionally, while waiting for the bucket to empty, the thread monitors
-- for changes to the version of the leaking period, indicating either that the
-- thread should pause running if the @leakingPeriodVersionSTM@ starts blocking
-- again or that the configuration changed as that it might have to wait less
-- long.
