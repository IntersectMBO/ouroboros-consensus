    -- 'boringDur'.
    --
    -- NOTE The generator does not yield consecutive 'TimePasses' commands,
    -- though shrinking might.
    --

    -- DRAFT NOTE An earlier design attempted to prevent TimePasses from ever landing
    -- exactly on an interesting moment, ie when some timeout expires. Notably:
    -- when a slot becomes too old or when the anti-thrashing limit expires.
    -- This is feasible and its complexity is tolerable for the generators.
    -- However, shrinking------wait, doesn't precondition guard against it?
