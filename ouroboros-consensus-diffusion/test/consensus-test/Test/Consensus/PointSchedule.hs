-- | Data types and generators that convert a 'BlockTree' to a 'PointSchedule'.
--
-- Point schedules can have arbitrary configurations that model different behaviors
-- we want to use for tests.
--
-- Each generator takes a set of 'AnchoredFragment's corresponding to the tested peers'
-- chains, and converts them to a 'PointSchedule' consisting of a sequence of states
-- ('AdvertisedPoints'), each of which is associated with a single peer.
--
-- When a schedule is executed in a test, each tick is processed in order.
-- The peer associated with the current tick is considered "active", which means that
-- its ChainSync server is allowed to continue processing messages, while all the other
-- peers' servers suspend operation by blocking on a concurrency primitive.
-- The state in the current tick determines the actions that the peer is allowed to perform,
-- and once it fulfills the state's criteria, it yields control back to the scheduler,
-- who then activates the next tick's peer.
--
-- /Note/: At the moment this implementation is experimental.
