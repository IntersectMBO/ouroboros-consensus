-- | This module provides a watcher of the invariants that are specific to the
-- ChainSync jumping (CSJ) implementation. Those invariants are typically
-- documented in the codebase but are not checked in any way, yet they are
-- crucial for CSJ to work properly. This watcher monitors the ChainSync
-- handlers and throws a 'Violation' exception when an invariant stops holding.
-- It is intended for testing purposes.
