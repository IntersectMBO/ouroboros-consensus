-- | Tests that the selection advances in presence of the LoE when a peer is
-- killed by something that is not LoE-aware, eg. the timeouts. This test
-- features an honest peer behaving normally and an adversarial peer behaving
-- such that it will get killed by timeouts. We check that, after the adversary
-- gets disconnected, the LoE gets updated to stop taking it into account. There
-- are two variants of the test: one with timeouts enabled, and one without. In
-- the case where timeouts are disabled, we check that we do in fact remain
-- stuck at the intersection between trunk and other chain.
--
-- NOTE: Same as 'LoP.prop_delayAttack' with timeouts instead of LoP.
