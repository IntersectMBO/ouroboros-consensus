-- | Test of ChainSync Jumping (CSJ).
--
-- This test features several peers the all sync the “honest” chain (ie. the
-- trunk of the block tree) with CSJ enabled. What we expect to observe is that
-- one of the honest peers becomes the dynamo while the others become jumpers.
-- Because the jumpers will agree to all the jumps, the whole syncing should
-- happen with CSJ.
--
-- There are two variants of this test: the “happy path” variant features no
-- adversaries. As such, everything should happen with one dynamo and no
-- objector. Another variant adds adversaries, so we expect to see some
-- dynamo-vs-objector action.
--
-- Regardless, the final property is that “honest” headers should only ever be
-- downloaded at most once from honest peers. They may however be downloaded
-- several times from adversaries. This is true except when almost caught-up:
-- when the dynamo or objector is caught-up, it gets disengaged and one of the
-- jumpers takes its place and starts serving headers. This might lead to
-- duplication of headers, but only in a window of @jumpSize@ slots near the tip
-- of the chain.
--
-- The first boolean differentiates between the “happy path” variant and the
-- variant with adversaries; the second boolean differentiates between
-- “synchronous” and “asynchronous” scenarios. In a synchronous scenario, all
-- the honest peers have the same schedule: they serve the chain exactly in the
-- same way. In the asynchronous scenario, a random schedule is generated for
-- each peer (but they still serve the same chain).
