-- Note [Leashing attacks]
--
-- A leashing attack would be successfully conducted by a point schedule meeting
-- either of two conditions:
--
-- 1) it causes the node under test to stop making progress (i.e. the immutable
--    tip doesn't get close to the last genesis window of the honest chain), or
-- 2) it causes the node under test to still make progress but it is too slow
--    (in some sense of slow)
--
-- We produce schedules meeting the first condition by dropping random points
-- from the schedule of adversarial peers. If peers don't send the headers or
-- the blocks that they promised with a tip point, the node under test could
-- wait indefinitely without advancing the immutable tip.
--
-- We produce schedules meeting the second condition by stopping the execution
-- of the schedule after an amount of time that depends on the amount of blocks
-- to sync up and the timeouts allowed by Limit of Patience.
-- If the adversarial peers succeed in delaying the immutable tip, interrupting
-- the test at this point should cause the immutable tip to be too far behind
-- the last genesis window of the honest chain.
