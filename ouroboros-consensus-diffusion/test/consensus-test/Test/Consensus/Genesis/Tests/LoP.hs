-- | Simple test where we serve all the chain at regular intervals, but just
-- slow enough to lose against the LoP bucket.
--
-- Let @c@ be the bucket capacity, @r@ be the bucket rate and @t@ be the time
-- between blocks, then the bucket level right right before getting the token
-- for the @k@th block will be:
--
-- > c - krt + (k-1)
--
-- (Note: if @rt â‰¥ 1@, otherwise it will simply be @c - rt@.) If we are to
-- survive at least (resp. succumb before) @k > 0@ blocks, then this value will
-- be positive (resp. negative). This is equivalent to saying that @rt@ must be
-- lower (resp. greater) than @(c+k-1) / k@.
--
-- We will have two versions of this test: one where we serve the @n-1@th block
-- but succumb before serving the @n@th block, and one where we do manage to
-- serve the @n@th block, barely.
