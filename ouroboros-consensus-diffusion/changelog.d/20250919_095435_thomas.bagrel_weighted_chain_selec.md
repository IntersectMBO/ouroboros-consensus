### Breaking

- In module `Ouroboros.Consensus.Node.GSM`, `GSMView` now has a monadic `getCandidateOverSelection :: STM m (selection -> chainSyncState -> CandidateVersusSelection)` instead of the previous pure `candidateOverSelection`. This is due to the fact that chain comparisons now depend on the set of Peras certificates (if Peras is enabled).
