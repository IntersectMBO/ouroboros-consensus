  abstract = {B-trees have become, de facto, a standard for file organization. File indexes of users,
dedicated database systems, and general-purpose access methods have all been proposed
and implemented using B-trees. This paper reviews B-trees and shows why they have
been so successful. It discusses the major variations of the B-tree, especially the B+-tree,
contrasting the relative merits and costs of each implementation. It illustrates a general
purpose access method which uses a B-tree. },
