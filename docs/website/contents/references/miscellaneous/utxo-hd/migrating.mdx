# Migrating to a UTxO-HD node as a user

This is a checklist of modifications needed to be performed by node users when
migrating to UTxO-HD. It aims to ease the transition for node 10.4.

## If building the node from source code: install the LMDB library

:::info

If you download the binary from the Github release, there is no need to install
`lmdb` as the distributed binary is statically linked.

:::

As the Consensus layer now allows for the use of the LMDB backend, the
development library needs to be present on the system for building. If
using Nix, this library will be available in the Nix shell. Otherwise,
it will have to be manually installed:

<div class="tabsblock">
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Debian/Ubuntu" default>
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update -y
    sudo apt-get install liblmdb-dev -y
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="fedora" label="Fedora, RedHat or CentOS">
  ```bash
  sudo yum update -y
  sudo yum install lmdb -y
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS">
  ```bash
  brew install lmdb
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows MSYS2">
  ```bash
  pacman -S mingw-w64-<env>-x86_64-lmdb
  ```

  Which for the `CLANG64` environment will be:

  ```bash
  pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-lmdb
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
</div>

## Populate the new configuration options

The shape of the configuration file was slightly altered to put together all the
options related to the LedgerDB into a JSON object `"LedgerDB"`. The shape of
this object is as follows:

```json
{
  ..., // other top level configuration options
  "LedgerDB": {
    "SnapshotInterval":   INT, //in seconds
    "NumOfDiskSnapshots": INT,
    "QueryBatchSize":     INT,
    "Backend":            <backend>
  }
}
```

Notice that `"SnapshotInterval"` and `"NumOfDiskSnapshots"` have moved from the
top-level to the `"LedgerDB"` object. The option `"DoDiskSnapshotChecksum"` has
been deleted as snapshots now include the metadata unconditionally.

By default, `"SnapshotInterval"` is set to $2  k = 4320$ seconds, and
`"NumOfDiskSnapshots"` is set to 2.

`"QueryBatchSize"` sets the size of the batches in which the store will be read
when querying the store for a big range of UTxOs (such as with
`QueryUTxOByAddress`). By default we read the store in batches of 100,000
values.

The value of `<backend>` depends on your choice of backend for UTxO-HD. It can
be one of these:

<div class="tabsblock">
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mem" label="In memory">

  This is the default value for `"Backend"` so you could leave it
  undefined. We suggest setting it anyways to avoid confusion.

  ```json
  {
    ...,
    "LedgerDB": {
      ...,
      "Backend": "V2InMemory"
    }
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="dsk" label="LMDB">
  ```json
  {
    ...,
    "LedgerDB": {
      ...,
      "Backend":        "V1LMDB",
      "FlushFrequency": INT,
      "MapSize":        INT,  // number of GBs
      "LiveTablesPath": PATH
    }
  }
  ```

The explanation for the new options applicable only to this backend
follows:


- `"FlushFrequency"`: The number of immutable blocks that need to exists before
  we flush the sequence of differences to the disk. Smaller implies more
  frequent disk writing, bigger implies more retained memory and slower
  consulting of values. By default it is set to 100 blocks.
- `"MapSize"`: LMDB needs to be given the desired mapsize with which the
  database is open. See the [LMDB
  docs](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/group__mdb.html#gaa2506ec8dab3d969b0e609cd82e619e5).
  By default we set this value to 16, which is fine on Linux as the file
  progressively grows. On Windows this will write a 16GB file directly on the
  disk. This is something that LMDB does, out of our control.
- `"LiveTablesPath"`: LMDB will use a live database on the file system to store
  the live UTxO set. Taking snapshots will "copy" this database to the snapshot
  path. Therefore this "live" database is not needed for starting a node (as the
  one from the snapshot will be used instead), but it will be used by the
  running node process. It is recommended that this path is **on SSD
  storage**. The default is `mainnet/db/lmdb`.

## Upgrading a Ledger snapshots from 10.4.x to 10.5.x

:::warning

Backup your ledger state snapshots before converting them to be safe in the
unlikely case that something fails during conversion.

:::

The format of the Ledger snapshots in the ChainDB has changed with UTxO-HD. The
simplest way to use the new format is deleting your snapshots and replaying the
chain from Genesis, however this can take some hours.

We provide the `snapshot-converter` tool which can load a snapshot in the Legacy
format and write it either in the in-memory or on-disk formats for
UTxO-HD.

:::info

On cardano-node 10.6 there was a change in serialization unrelated to the
UTxO-HD changes. This means that going from 10.4.x to 10.5.x can benefit from
this doing a quick conversion using `snapshot-converter` as explained here, but
it won't work when the target is 10.6 or newer. Such a format update can
only be done via a replay of the chain.

The `snapshot-converter` tool still exists in the repository and will convert
between the different UTxO-HD formats but it will no longer be able to load a
snapshot older than 10.6, and therefore it won't be able to "upgrade" a Legacy
snapshot to a UTxO-HD snapshot anymore.

For this reason, the process below is only useful for upgrading from 10.4.x to
10.5.x, and **it must be performed with the `snapshot-converter` version that
was released with nodes 10.5.x**.

:::

Supposing you have copied a legacy snapshot to `<tmpdir>/snapshots/<slotno>` you
can run the following command:

<div class="tabsblock">
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="mem" label="In memory">
```console
$ cd <tmpdir>
$ snapshot-converter Legacy ./snapshots/<slotno> Mem ./snapshots/<slotno>_mem cardano --config <path-to-config.json>
$ rm -rf <dbDir>/ledger/*
$ cp -r ./snapshots/<slotno>_mem <dbDir>/ledger/<slotno>
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dsk" label="LMDB">
```console
$ cd <tmpdir>
$ snapshot-converter Legacy ./snapshots/<slotno> LMDB ./snapshots/<slotno>_lmdb cardano --config <path-to-config.json>
$ rm -rf <dbDir>/ledger/*
$ cp -r ./snapshots/<slotno>_lmdb <dbDir>/ledger/<slotno>
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</div>

:::warning

You can do this process directly in the snapshots directory in the database
path, but you have to make sure you delete the old format snapshots before
running the node as otherwise you would have two snapshots with the same slot
number and the node would be free to pick the one with the old format
again. Doing the conversion in a separate directory and then copying only the
new format snapshot prevents this situation.

:::

:::warning

In the command above, the target name for the copy of the new snapshot has no
suffix. The snapshot deleting logic omits suffixed snapshots as those are
considered "important" snapshots the user wants to keep around. So if you keep
the suffix in the snapshot name then the node will never delete such snapshot
even if it has two other much more recent snapshots.

:::

This will create a snapshot with the proper format for UTxO-HD. See [the UTxO-HD
in depth document](utxo-hd_in_depth.md#storing-snapshots) for more
information on the contents of the different files in the snapshot.

If the snapshot does not have the expected structure or the backend for which it
was created is different from the backend used by the node, the node will issue
a warning mentioning the `snapshot-converter` and will ignore such snapshot.
