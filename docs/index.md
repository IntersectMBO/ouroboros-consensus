This document provides an index to different Consensus documents:

- [Adding an era](AddingAnEra.md): the Cardano blockchain spans multiple eras,
  each of which introduce a hard-fork. The process for adding an era to
  `ouroboros-consensus-cardano` is documented in this file. TODO: this is
  Cardano specific, and maybe it should not live inside consensus.
- [An overview of Consensus](AnOverviewOfConsensus.md): provides a
  very high-level motivation for the goal of Consensus, and describes its
  neighboring components.
- [Chain sync](ChainSync.md): describes the chain-sync client specification.
- [Git process](GitProcess.md): describes the git process we
  follow when developing Consensus.
- [Profiling tips and tricks](ProfilingTipsAndTricks.md): contains
  tips and tricks that can be useful when profiling Consensus.
- [References](References.md): lists references that help in understanding the
  design and implementation of Consensus, as well as its theoretical
  foundations.
- [Style guide](StyleGuide.md): describes the style guide we use when developing
  Consensus.
- [Testing](Testing.md): describes our approach for testing consensus.
- [Interface changelog](interface-CHANGELOG.md): lists changes that are
  important for downstream Cardano development teams.
- [Hard won wisdom](HardWonWisdom.md) contains several realizations we had while
  working on the code base. This could be used both as a place to look random
  information, and source of inspiration for further improving our
  documentation.
