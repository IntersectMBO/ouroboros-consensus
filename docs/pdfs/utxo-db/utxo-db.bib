dedicated database systems, and general-purpose access methods have all been proposed
and nnplemented using B-trees This paper reviews B-trees and shows why they have
been so successful It discusses the major variations of the B-tree, especially the B+-tree,
contrasting the relatwe merits and costs of each implementatmn. It illustrates a general
purpose access method whmh uses a B-tree. },
